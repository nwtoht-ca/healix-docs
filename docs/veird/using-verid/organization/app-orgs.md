# App Organizations

 An App organization develops solutions for provider organizations.  

 App Organizations are free to interpret [Roles](/veird/using-verid/people/roles) as they see fit.

 In the case of Healix, people with a Staff role are able to edit plans, people with User roles are able to test run plans and people with an Admin role can approve plans.
