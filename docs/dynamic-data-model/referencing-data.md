# Data References

Some functions need coordinates for a data point.  This generally done like

```
entity.category.field
```

For example, to get a field named "field1" from a form named "form1":

```
submission.form1.field1
```

Or to read the status of a plan:

```
carePlan.status
```

These data references are used by by *[Healix Expression Grammar](/docs/dynamic-data-model/healix-calculation-grammar)* discussed next.
