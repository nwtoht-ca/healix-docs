# Dynamic Data Model

As plans and work queues are configured, a *Dynamic Data Model* is created based on the definitions created.

Any [form](/creating-plans/forms-and-fields/form-editor) that is created extends the data model with all its fields. 

A plan has a number of fixed fields and [Content Managers](/using-healix/user-types#content-manager) can add new plan fields with [Custom Fields](/creating-plans/forms-and-fields/custom-fields).  

Integrations defined in a plan also extend the dynamic data model.

Work Queue Items also have a number of fixed fields that can be accessed via work queue name.
