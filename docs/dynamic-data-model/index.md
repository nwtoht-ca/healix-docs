# Dynamic Data Model

As forms and custom fields are added to a plan, a *Dynamic Data Model* is created based on the [form](/creating-plans/forms-and-fields/form-editor) and field names.  A plan has a number of fixed fields and [Content Managers](/using-healix/user-types#content-manager) can add new plan fields with [Custom Fields](/creating-plans/forms-and-fields/custom-fields).
