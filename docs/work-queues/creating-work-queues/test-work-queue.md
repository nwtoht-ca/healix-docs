# Testing a Work Queue Configuration

Testing a work queue configuration is done with plan template editor [simulator](../../creating-plans/simulator/).  When accessing a work queue definition from the simulator, the latest, unpublished (In Review status) is used.

Once the you have completed the testing of the work queue configuration, save the work queue with the Active status and real users.
