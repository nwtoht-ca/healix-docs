# Library

Your Healix Library is where you will find helpful **resource**, **education** and **reference materials** in the form of **videos**, **external links** and **documents**. Items will have a “New” tag until you have viewed them. The red badge on the Library tab keeps track of how many "New" items are in your Library.
