# Designations

Designations are tags that can be applied to people.

Staff will typically have professional designations such as "Registered Nurse", "Nurse Practitioner", "Occupational Therapist", "Licensed Real Estate Agent", etc.

User Designations are high application specific.  For example, a hospital may tag end users as being a certified volunteer.

:::note

Jurisdiction admin privileges are required to add designations.

Organizational admin privileges are required to add designations to people. A person's designation is stored for an organization's relationship with a person, not on the person itself.
