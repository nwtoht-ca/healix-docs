**Tags** - choose on or more tags from a list of Tags.  The list of Tags is created on the main Test tab

**Description** - a or sentence or two about what the test case does

**Steps** - The steps table has a list of steps to perform when running the test. The first step, which is created for you, is to set the time. You can add new steps by pressing the *Record* button or add a step manually with the *Add Step* button.

* Export it to a file
* Create a new test case
* Import the file created
