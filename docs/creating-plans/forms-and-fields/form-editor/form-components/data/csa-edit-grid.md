# CSA Edit Grid

The CSA Edit Grid replicates a table-like structure when it comes to the capture and display of form data. Users can add multiple components inside the Edit Grid. Additionally, any number of grids can be added within a form, which is especially useful when needing the ability to add or duplicate multiple fieldsets. There is also flexibility in how the Edit Grid data rows are saved and displayed to the end user.
