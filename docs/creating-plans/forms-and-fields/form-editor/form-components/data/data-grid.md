# Data Grid

Data Grids allow users to add multiple components on to a line item grid. Once placed,
users can add multiple components inside of the Data Grid. Additionally, any number of grids can be added within a form which is especially useful when needing the ability to add or duplicate multiple fields sets.

From the Data component menu, add the Data Gird (Array) to any active form. By default the grid is empty but can have other form components placed inside.
