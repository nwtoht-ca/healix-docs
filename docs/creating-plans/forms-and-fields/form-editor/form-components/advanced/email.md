# Email

The email component is nearly identical to the text field component. The Email component has a custom validation setting that, if set up correctly, can ensure the value entered is a valid email address. The email component can also more easily be integrate into a formâ€™s email action. Use this component when you want an email address field for your form.

## Realtime Email Validation using [Kickbox.io](https://kickbox.io/)

In addition to the normal email format validation, we are excited to bring real-time Email validation through our integration with Kickbox.io. For more information on how this works, please checkout the [Kickbox Integration](http://localhost:4000/developer/integrations/email/#kickbox) section.
