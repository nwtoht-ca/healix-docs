# Rules Shorthand Syntax

When defining the business logic for a rule to fire, a value is entered into the decision table.  This causes the rules engine to compare the value entered in the decision table with the field specified in the column header.

The default comparison (a.k.a. operator), is equality.  For example, if the column field is *gender* with the choice of "male" or "female", if you enter "male" and a user submits a form where gender is equal to "male" the rule will fire. 

You you wanted a comparison (operator) other than equals, you can enter is before the value.  For example, if the column field is *age*, you could enter <50.  If the user submits a form with a value of age less than fifty, then the rule will fire.

Do not surround text values with quotes.

If you enter a value in more than one column for a given row (rule) each of the comparisons must be true in order for the rule to fire.  In other words, the values are logically ANDed.

Do not confuse the *Rules Short Hand Syntax* with the [Healix Expression Grammar](/dynamic-data-model/healix-calculation-grammar). The rules syntax is further simplified and always assumes a comparison will be provided.  The  [Healix Expression Grammar](/dynamic-data-model/healix-calculation-grammar) can compute an arbitray calculation and is not necessarily a comparison.

## Field Types and Accepted Values and Operators

The field type being compared determines what values and operators are acceptable.

### Boolean

Boolean fields (fields with only a true or false, on/off values) only accept equality operators.

eq someText (a variation of =)

notEq someText (a variation of !=)

:::caution

Date comparisons are not support.  Support for dates will be added by adding Expression column types. Thus you can compute the difference between two dates in a column to compute a duration and then use the number operator.
