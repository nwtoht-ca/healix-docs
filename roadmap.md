# Roadmap

## Creating Templates
### Roles Improvements
#### Role visibility
* The current role visibility impacts all users.  We intend to allow a content manager to define how any given role can view another. (E.g. a Patient Supporter's contact details may be visible to Providers by hidden to patients, opposed to hidden to all)
### Forms Improvements
#### Template Scoped Forms
* Currently forms exist in a global space, meaning any plan template can reference an individual form.  We are changing this so that a form's scope is limited to the current template.  This means that you edit the forms within the template editor and editing a form cannot inadvertently break other templates.
